# BeatDetectorForGames
A C++ and C# Beat Detector to be used in Video Games. 

Can take in a song and detect where beats occur, such as in games like Vib-Ribbon.

Should theoretically work with any C++ or C# Games framework. Look in the folders README files for instructions

Currently only works on Windows machines, and the C++ version only works on Visual Studio for now.

Feel free to mess around with it, I'm sure there are improvements that can be made :D

Please note that if you intend to use this for a commercial game (i.e to sell) you will need to look at FMOD's licenseing policies. I made this under the FMOD Non-Commerical license.
